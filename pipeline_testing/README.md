This management can be done using multiple tools, such as the following:
- Apache Airflow
- Prefect
- Luigi
- etc.

However, for simplicity, we will use Prefect.
Future versions can test other tools.

Will need to test the following workflows:
- Spike sorting only
- EMG processing only (both BSA and QDA)
- Spike sorting + EMG processing (both BSA and QDA)
