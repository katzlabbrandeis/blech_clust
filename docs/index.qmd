## Overview

**blech_clust** is a comprehensive Python and R based toolkit for clustering and sorting electrophysiology data recorded using the Intan RHD2132 chips. Originally written for cortical multi-electrode recordings in Don Katz's lab at Brandeis University, it's optimized for high-performance computing clusters but can be easily modified to work in any parallel environment.

Visit the [Katz lab website](https://sites.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/katzlab/) for more information.

## Key Features

- **EMG Analysis**: Multiple approaches including BSA/STFT and QDA-based gape detection
- **Quality Assessment**: Built-in tools for dataset quality grading and validation
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimized for HPC environments
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed API reference and tutorials

## Pipeline Overview

### Spike Sorting Pipeline

1. **blech_exp_info.py** - Pre-clustering step to annotate channels and save experimental parameters
2. **blech_clust.py** - Setup directories and define clustering parameters
3. **blech_common_avg_reference.py** - Perform common average referencing
4. **blech_run_process.sh** - Parallel spike extraction and clustering
5. **blech_post_process.py** - Add selected units to HDF5 file
6. **blech_units_plot.py** - Plot waveforms of selected spikes
7. **blech_make_arrays.py** - Generate spike-train arrays
8. **blech_run_QA.sh** - Quality assurance checks
9. **blech_unit_characteristics.py** - Analyze unit characteristics
10. **blech_data_summary.py** - Generate comprehensive dataset summary
11. **grade_dataset.py** - Grade dataset quality based on metrics

### EMG Analysis Pipelines

**Shared Steps:**
1. Complete spike sorting through `blech_make_arrays.py`
2. `emg_filter.py` - Filter EMG signals

**BSA/STFT Branch:**
- Bayesian Spectrum Analysis and Short-Time Fourier Transform for frequency analysis

**QDA Branch:**
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis for gape detection (based on Li et al.'s methodology)
