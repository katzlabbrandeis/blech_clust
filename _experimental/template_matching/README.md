Functionality to extract waveforms using template similarity rather than amplitude threshold.

1- Generate waveform templates
2- Compute similarity scores between incoming signals and templates
    - Make sure signal parameters are same as those used to generate templates
3- Set a similarity threshold to identify matches
4- Extract waveforms that exceed the similarity threshold
5- Validate extracted waveforms against known events or benchmarks
