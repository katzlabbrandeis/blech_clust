# Waveform Snippet Extraction Features

## Overview

The raw data viewer has been enhanced with comprehensive waveform snippet extraction capabilities, allowing users to visualize individual spike waveforms that cross a user-defined threshold within the current viewing window.

## Key Features

### 1. Threshold-Based Spike Detection
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies waveforms crossing user-defined threshold
- **Polarity Separation**: Distinguishes between positive and negative threshold crossings
- **Real-time Processing**: Extracts snippets from current viewing window only
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: User-adjustable threshold values

### 2. Fixed Time Window Extraction
- **Before Time**: Fixed time before threshold crossing (default: 0.5ms)
- **After Time**: Fixed time after threshold crossing (default: 1.0ms)
- **Independent Scaling**: Snippet windows are independent of main plot window duration
- **Sample Precision**: Automatically converts milliseconds to samples based on sampling rate
- **Boundary Handling**: Ensures snippets don't exceed data boundaries

### 3. Advanced Visualization
- **Individual Waveforms**: Plots all extracted snippets with transparency
- **Average Waveforms**: Calculates and displays average for each polarity
- **Color Coding**: Blue for negative spikes, red for positive spikes
- **Reference Lines**: Shows threshold crossing point and peak alignment
- **Statistics Display**: Shows count of snippets by polarity

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Window-Based Processing**: Only processes current viewing window
- **Snippet Limiting**: User-configurable maximum number of snippets (default: 50)
- **Memory Efficient**: Clears snippets when window changes
- **Real-time Updates**: Snippets update automatically during navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Spike Detection Algorithm

Based on the `extract_waveforms_abu` function from `utils/clustering.py`:

1. **Threshold Calculation**: Uses user-defined threshold relative to data mean
2. **Crossing Detection**: Identifies samples above/below threshold
3. **Event Grouping**: Groups consecutive threshold crossings into events
4. **Peak Finding**: Locates extrema (minima/maxima) within each event
5. **Snippet Extraction**: Extracts waveforms around each peak
6. **Quality Control**: Ensures snippets have complete before/after windows

### GUI Integration

- **Snippet Controls Row**: Added to control grid (Row 7)
- **Dedicated Subplot**: Separate plot area below main display
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrated with existing display update cycle
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of invalid parameters

### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
# 1. Load current window data
data, time_array = load_channel_data(...)

# 2. Apply conversion factor
data = data * 0.6745  # Convert to microvolts

# 3. Apply filtering (if enabled)
if filter_enabled:
    data = apply_filter(data)

# 4. Extract snippets (if enabled and threshold set)
if show_snippets and threshold_set:
    snippets, times, polarities = extract_snippets(data, threshold)
    plot_snippets(snippets, polarities)
```

## User Interface

### Control Elements

1. **Before (ms)**: Text box for pre-threshold time (default: 0.5ms)
2. **After (ms)**: Text box for post-threshold time (default: 1.0ms)
3. **Max Snippets**: Text box for display limit (default: 50)
4. **Show Snippets**: Checkbox to enable/disable extraction

**Note**: Snippet window durations are fixed time values independent of the main plot window duration.

### Display Elements

1. **Main Plot**: Continuous data with threshold line
2. **Snippet Plot**: Individual and average waveforms
3. **Statistics**: Snippet counts and polarity information
4. **Reference Lines**: Threshold crossing and peak alignment markers

4. Adjust snippet window parameters if needed
5. Navigate through data to see snippets from different time periods

### Advanced Usage
1. Apply filtering to enhance spike visibility
2. Adjust snippet windows for different spike types
3. Use manual Y-scaling for better snippet visualization
4. Compare snippets across different channels
5. Validate threshold settings before full spike sorting

## Integration with Existing Features

### Seamless Integration
